    <li><strong>Key components:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, etc.)</li>
        <li>Connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa)</li>
        <li>Cloud and Edge Platforms</li>
        <li>Data analytics and dashboards</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Smart thermostats, wearable health trackers, smart agriculture, home automation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Slide 4: Where Robotics Meets IoT</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The fusion of Robotics and IoT creates <strong>smart, connected robots</strong>.</li>
    <li>Benefits:
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time communication and data exchange</li>
        <li>Remote monitoring and control</li>
        <li>Improved decision-making with cloud analytics</li>
        <li>Integration into smart environments (homes, factories)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Slide 5: Real-World Example</h2>
  <p><strong>Warehouse Robot with IoT Integration</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses GPS and LIDAR sensors for navigation</li>
    <li>Tracks inventory levels and locations</li>
    <li>Sends performance and maintenance data to the cloud</li>
    <li>Receives instructions remotely</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Slide 6: Benefits for Real-Time Operations (RTOs)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enhanced responsiveness and uptime in critical systems</li>
    <li>Real-time telemetry enables predictive maintenance and faster recovery</li>
    <li>Robots adapt immediately to dynamic conditions (e.g., supply chain fluctuations)</li>
    <li>IoT-enabled robots contribute to operational resilience and continuity</li>
    <li>Example: In disaster scenarios, autonomous drones with IoT can rapidly assess damage and transmit live data to emergency services</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Slide 7: Predictive Maintenance and Operational Efficiency</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Predictive Maintenance:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to 50% reduction in unplanned downtime</li>
        <li>18–25% savings in maintenance costs</li>
        <li>Based on real-time sensor data and machine learning analytics</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to 30% reduction in total maintenance expenses</li>
        <li>Up to 70% fewer equipment failures</li>
        <li>Real-time visibility helps optimize workflow, inventory, and energy use</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Symbotic (Warehouse Automation):</strong> Robotic systems integrated with real-time analytics are deployed across major retailers (e.g. Walmart, Target), cutting labor needs, increasing throughput, and enabling adaptive inventory control. Though specific ROI figures are private, adoption by large-scale operations like Walmart strongly suggests substantial savings and operational uptime benefits</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Slide 8: Challenges with Robotics and IoT Integration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> More connected endpoints increase attack surface; vulnerabilities in firmware, protocols, or cloud systems</li>
    <li><strong>Data Overload & Management:</strong> High data volume requires filtering, storage, and analysis solutions; need for edge computing</li>
    <li><strong>Connectivity & Interoperability:</strong> Devices must reliably connect across varying standards; integration challenges with different vendors</li>
    <li><strong>High Cost & Complexity:</strong> Infrastructure, training, and system design can be expensive; complex deployment and debugging</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical & Regulatory Concerns:</strong> Privacy, surveillance, and data ownership issues; regulatory gaps for autonomous and IoT-enabled systems</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Slide 9: Conclusion – Looking Ahead</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The convergence of Robotics and IoT is transforming industries by creating intelligent, autonomous, and connected systems.</li>
